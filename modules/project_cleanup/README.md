This module schedules a job to clean up GCP projects older than a specified length of time, that match a particular labels. This job runs every 5 minutes via Google Cloud Scheduled Functions. Please see the [utility's readme](./function_source/README.md) for more information as to its operation and configuration.

## Requirements

### App Engine
