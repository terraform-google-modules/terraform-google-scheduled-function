# Old Project Cleanup Utility Module

This module schedules a job to clean up GCP projects older than a specified length of time, that match a particular labels. This job runs every 5 minutes via Google Cloud Scheduled Functions. Please see the [utility's readme](./function_source/README.md) for more information as to its operation and configuration.

## Requirements

### App Engine

Running this module requires an App Engine app in the specified project/region. More information is in the [root readme](../../README.md#app-engine).

### Enabled Services

The following services must be enabled on the project housing the cleanup function prior to invoking this module:

- Artifact Registry API (`artifactregistry.googleapis.com`)
- Cloud Functions (`cloudfunctions.googleapis.com`)
- Cloud Scheduler (`cloudscheduler.googleapis.com`)
- Cloud Resource Manager (`cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com`)
- Compute Engine API (`compute.googleapis.com`)
- Cloud Asset API (`cloudasset.googleapis.com`)
- Security Command Center API (`securitycenter.googleapis.com`)
- Cloud Logging API (`logging.googleapis.com`)
